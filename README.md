# ideation

This repository is for the ideation of the project. It is a place to share ideas and discuss them.

## At each round

- [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
- Write a new file in the `roundX` directory with your PennKey and the `.md` extension (i.e., I would write a file called `lumbroso.md`) according to `TEMPLATE.md` (see also `SAMPLE-1.md` and `SAMPLE-2.md` for examples).
- [Create a pull request from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Rounds

Here are how the rounds are structured:

- **Round 1 (15-20 mins):** Think on your own about a single story that you will submit in `round1` directory.
- **Round 2 (15-20 mins):**
  - Pair up with someone else,
  - Each present each other's idea (5 mins)
  - Determine which idea is the one you most would like to work on (2 min)
  - Expand the idea with 5 more user stories (8 mins)
  - Submit the expanded idea in `round2` directory under the name of the person who's idea it originally was.
- **Round 3 (15-20 mins):**
  - Pair up with another pair (4 people in total, 2 ideas)
  - Each present each other's idea (5 mins)
  - Determine which idea is the one you most would like to work on (2 min)
